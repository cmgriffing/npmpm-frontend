# NPMPM Frontend

This is the frontend repo for [npmpm.com](https://npmpm.com). It is built with [Remix](https://remix.run). The main reason for creating it was to showcase the Microsoft Identity Verifiable Credentials APIs. But it's also just a fun game to play.

We also allow Github OAuth as a secondary auth mechanism for those that are not eager to try out the Verifiable Credential API.

If you are looking for the backend you can find it here: [https://github.com/cmgriffing/npmpm-backend](https://github.com/cmgriffing/npmpm-backend)

## Verifiable Credentials

If you would like to learn more about the process, I suggest you head to the Microsoft documentation to learn more: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/verifiable-credentials/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/verifiable-credentials/)
